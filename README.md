# House_Price_Prediction_T7
This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict the continuous sale price of houses based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms. It provides a hands-on learning experience in supervised learning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model interpretation

Key Tasks =>
Load & Explore:
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
Investigate the distribution of prices and their correlations with other features.
Clean & Prepare:
Address missing values with appropriate strategies.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., neighborhood, house style) using One-Hot Encoding.
Divide data into training and test sets for robust evaluation.
Feature Engineering:
Develop new features like age of the house and total square footage.
Assess correlations between features and the target (SalePrice) to enhance model accuracy.
Build & Train:
Construct a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
Fine-tune the model with optimal parameters.
Evaluate & Interpret:
Assess model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Examine coefficients to identify features with the most significant positive or negative impact on price.
